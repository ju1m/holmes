Module      : Data.JoinSemilattice.Intersect
Description : Solving problems by reducing lists of candidates.
Copyright   : (c) Tom Harding, 2020
License     : MIT

When we play games like Guess Who?, we start with a set of possible candidates,
and eliminate subsets of them as the game progresses. The 'Intersect' type
works in a similar way: each cell stores a list of its potential values, and
the merging operation takes the __intersect__ of the current candidates and the
new candidates.
